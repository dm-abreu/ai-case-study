## Everyone can code

## Company Overview and Origin

* Sourcegraph

* Incorporated: 2013

* Founders: Quinn Slack, Beyang Liu, and David Crawshaw

* The founders saw the need for a better way to search and understand code as they worked on their own projects. They felt that existing code search tools were inadequate and that there was a need for a more comprehensive and intelligent approach.

* Total Funding: $112.8M (as of October 2023); Investors: GV (formerly Google Ventures), Kleiner Perkins, Scale Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and others


## Business Activities

* Developers spend a significant amount of time searching for and understanding code, which can be inefficient and time-consuming. Existing code search tools are often inadequate, providing inaccurate results and lacking context. Developers need a better way to navigate and understand codebases, especially as they become larger and more complex.

* Sourcegraph's target customers include software developers of all levels, from individual developers to large organizations. The market size for this set of customers is vast, with millions of developers worldwide.

* Sourcegraph's key differentiator is its ability to create a unified searchable index across multiple code sources. This allows developers to find code quickly and easily, regardless of where it is stored. Additionally, Sourcegraph uses machine learning to understand the relationships between different pieces of code, which provides developers with a deeper understanding of the codebase. Sourcegraph's open-core business model allows them to offer a free version of their product, which has helped them to gain traction in the market.

* On the technology side, Sourcegraph uses a distributed architecture, including a code analysis backend written in Go which leverages databases like MySQL and Postgres. The browser extension and web app are built using TypeScript and JavaScript. They are implementing code analysis techniques like abstract syntax trees to power advanced code intelligence features.
